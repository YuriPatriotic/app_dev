# **My Favorite Series of All Time**

# 1. **Friends**

## *SitCom TV Show*

Friends is an American television sitcom that originally aired on NBC from 1994 to 2004. Created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, the show follows the lives, relationships, and everyday adventures of six close friends living in New York City.

My mother and older brother recommended this show to me back in highschool and I deepy enjoyed it. It is about a group of adult friends who basically does normal things like going to work and also hanging out with each other. The way the characters intereact with one another is very entertaining because of their unique attitudes and characteristics. The show is also home to a bunch of iconic sceneries like **Monica's apartment** and **Central Perk Coffeehouse**. Those two places also have their own Lego sets.

# 2. **Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded Ophans**

## *Anime*

Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans (機動戦士ガンダム 鉄血のオルフェンズ, Kidō Senshi Gandamu: Tekketsu no Orufenzu) is a Japanese anime television series produced by Sunrise (now Bandai Namco Filmworks). It is part of the long-running Gundam franchise but tells a standalone story separate from previous entries.

Set over 300 years after the Calamity War, a devastating conflict between Earth and its outer colonies, the series takes place in an era where Mars is under Earth’s control and social inequality is widespread.

The story follows a group of young, impoverished child soldiers working for a private security company called CGS. After being betrayed by their superiors, they rebel and take control, forming their own mercenary group called Tekkadan (“Iron Flower”).

This Anime is like when Gundam meet Barbaric weapons and violence. The anime itself is underrated on my opinion because of its style. Unlike normal Gundam designs, IBO's design is more slimmer and less blocky making it look more on the harsher side. The story is what I liked about the anime. It shows depictions of horrors of war and other dark topics like children in war, assassination, occupation etc. This is also my first Gundam series that I watched and I deeply enjoyed it.

# 3. **Clannad**

## *Anime*

Clannad (クラナド) is a Japanese visual novel developed by Key and later adapted into a popular anime series produced by Kyoto Animation. The anime aired from 2007 to 2008, followed by its direct sequel Clannad: After Story (2008–2009). It is widely regarded as one of the most emotional and heartwarming anime ever made.

The story takes place in a small Japanese town and follows Tomoya Okazaki, a high school delinquent who feels disconnected from life due to family troubles and a lack of motivation.

One day, he meets Nagisa Furukawa, a shy girl who is repeating her senior year because of illness. Despite her frail health, she dreams of reviving the school’s drama club. Moved by her determination, Tomoya decides to help her — and through this, his life slowly begins to change.

As the story progresses, Tomoya befriends other girls, each with their own emotional struggles, and helps them overcome their personal challenges. But the true core of Clannad lies in Tomoya and Nagisa’s deepening relationship, which continues into After Story, where the narrative shifts to adult life, marriage, and parenthood.

I found this anime because of curiosity online. This is probably one of the saddest anime there is and it still haunts my soul to this day.

# 4. **Hotel De Luna**

**K-Drama**

Hotel Del Luna (호텔 델루나) is a South Korean fantasy-romance drama that aired on tvN from July to September 2019. It stars IU (Lee Ji-eun) and Yeo Jin-goo, and was written by the famous Hong sisters (You’re Beautiful, My Girlfriend is a Gumiho, Alchemy of Souls).

Hidden in the heart of Seoul stands the mysterious Hotel Del Luna, a magical hotel that caters exclusively to ghosts. The establishment is invisible to the living and serves as a resting place for souls before they move on to the afterlife.

The hotel’s CEO, Jang Man-wol (played by IU), is a beautiful but cold and cynical woman who has been bound to the hotel for over 1,300 years due to a sin she committed in her past life. She cannot leave until she finds redemption and lets go of her lingering resentment.

One day, the hotel gains a new general manager — Gu Chan-sung (played by Yeo Jin-goo) — a kind, rational, and compassionate young man who can see ghosts. Forced into the job by fate and a deal made by his father years ago, Chan-sung becomes responsible for running the hotel and helping restless souls find peace.

As they work together, Man-wol and Chan-sung’s relationship deepens, and through him, she begins to rediscover her humanity and confront the tragic secrets of her past.

As an IU fanboy, I enjoyed this Kdrama and I rewatched it multiple times.
